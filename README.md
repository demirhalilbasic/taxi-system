# üöï Taxi System Simulation v1.0

The Taxi System Simulation project is a significant endeavor developed in the shell (bash) programming language. It serves as an impressive showcase of proficiency in shell scripting, combining CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality with additional features and capabilities. The system consists of two distinct sides: the admin and user interfaces. Upon login, users are directed to either the admin or user side based on the provided login parameters.

The system is dynamic, as predefined arrays of admins and users can be potentially updated through functions, enabling the addition of new users to the system. The admin interface offers a range of options, including adding, editing, and deleting information about available taxi vehicles. Some of the editable parameters include the vehicle's license plate number (serving as an identifier), its status (whether it's available or occupied), and additional information that helps users recognize the specific vehicle.

While the user interface offers a more limited set of options, they are equally significant. The standout feature is the ability to reserve a taxi, considering parameters such as the starting point, destination, reservation time, and the number of passengers. The system calculates the reservation price based on these factors, generating a random number as the base fare while factoring in the given parameters (displayed in the Preview section below). Additionally, users can access a history of their past taxi reservations.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

The Taxi System Simulation project can be easily installed without the need for any additional software. It is designed to run on most operating systems, ensuring compatibility and flexibility. The shell script, which powers the simulation, can be executed on various platforms, including Linux, macOS, and other Unix-like systems.

Steps to run shell script:
1. Download the project file: "main_taxi.sh"
2. Open a terminal or command prompt on your operating system.
3. Navigate to the directory where the project files are located. For example, if the file is on your desktop, use the following command:
```bash
cd ~/Desktop
```
4. Make sure the shell script file has executable permissions. If not, grant the necessary permissions using the following command:
```bash
chmod +x main_taxi.sh
```
5. Run the shell script by executing the following command:
```bash
./main_taxi.sh
```

The Taxi System Simulation has been created and thoroughly tested on Zorin OS Lite, a Linux distribution.
